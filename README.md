# Daily Word Landing Page
Small express app using cheerio/ jquery to pull word of the day from dictionary.com

This project extends a Traversy Media [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI). Huge thanks to them!
 
Great for containerizing and/or testing cloud deployments!

Try it out:
